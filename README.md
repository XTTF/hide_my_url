# hide_my_url

##URL Obfuscation Application

This app is similar to a URL shortener like bit.ly.  However, instead of shortening the length of the URL, the purpose is to mask the true destination of a link.  The app should do the following:

* Users can submit any URL to a form on the home page.  The application will then display an obfuscated version of that URL that, when visited, will redirect to the original URL.

* Using the Django admin center, admin users can log in, view links, and delete them.

* Admin users should be able to view the total number of times an obfuscated link has been clicked.
